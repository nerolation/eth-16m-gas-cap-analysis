### Migration Strategies

Based on pattern analysis, the following migration strategies are recommended:

1. **MEV Bots** (~40% of top 50): Split operations into search and execution phases
2. **Batch Processors** (~25%): Reduce batch sizes from 1000 to 500-700 operations
3. **DeFi Protocols** (~20%): Optimize routing algorithms and split complex operations
4. **Data Storage** (~15%): Chunk large data posts across multiple transactions

### Conclusions

1. The proposed gas cap would affect less than 0.04% of all transactions
2. Economic impact is minimal, with maximum individual cost under 0.05 ETH over 6 months
3. All identified use cases have viable migration paths
4. The cap would improve network DoS resistance without disrupting major protocols
5. Impact is concentrated among sophisticated automated systems that can adapt
