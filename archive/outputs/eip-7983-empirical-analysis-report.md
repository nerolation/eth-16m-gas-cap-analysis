# Empirical Analysis Report: EIP-7983 Transaction Gas Limit Cap

## Executive Summary

This report presents an empirical analysis of EIP-7983, which proposes capping transaction gas limits at 16,777,216 (2^24). Based on analysis of 190,446 Ethereum mainnet transactions, we find that the proposed cap would affect only 0.02% of transactions with minimal economic impact, strongly supporting the proposal's feasibility.

## Key Findings

### 1. Minimal Transaction Impact
- **Affected Transactions**: 38 out of 190,446 (0.02%)
- **Unique Addresses Affected**: 17
- **Distribution**: Gas usage follows a highly right-skewed distribution (skewness: 19.37)

### 2. Negligible Economic Impact
- **Total Additional Costs**: 0.0029 ETH for all affected transactions
- **Average Cost per Transaction**: 0.000076 ETH
- **Maximum Individual Cost**: 0.000208 ETH

### 3. Current Gas Usage Patterns
| Percentile | Gas Limit |
|------------|-----------|
| 50th (Median) | 84,000 |
| 90th | 300,000 |
| 95th | 498,540 |
| 99th | 2,000,000 |
| 99.9th | 9,866,240 |
| 99.99th | 21,000,000 |

## Impact Analysis

### Affected Transaction Characteristics
- **Average Gas Limit**: 27,983,667 (affected transactions)
- **Maximum Gas Limit**: 30,000,000
- **Total Excess Gas**: 425,845,134

### Address Concentration
The impact is concentrated among a small number of addresses:
1. `0x4fb9bbb1838ee0acb7b4d2e519a4c233198499fb`: 9 transactions
2. `0xd4abcbef17e002266a15ce9b7a678c4030ef4b0f`: 6 transactions
3. `0x3df54eda69d8b61f651ac6b65e534e489b88cbd5`: 4 transactions

### Transaction Splitting Requirements
Affected transactions would need to be split into multiple smaller transactions:
- **Average Splits Required**: 1.7 transactions
- **Additional Base Gas Cost**: 21,000 gas per additional transaction
- **Cost Increase**: ~0.3% of original transaction cost

## Technical Benefits Assessment

### 1. DoS Protection Enhancement
The cap significantly reduces the attack surface for DoS attempts by limiting the maximum computational resources any single transaction can consume.

### 2. zkVM Compatibility
The 16,777,216 limit aligns well with zkVM circuit constraints, enabling:
- More efficient proof generation
- Better parallelization opportunities
- Reduced circuit complexity

### 3. Load Balancing Improvement
With transactions capped at ~56% of a 30M gas block:
- More predictable execution patterns
- Better thread utilization in parallel execution
- Reduced worst-case latency

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Backward Compatibility
- 99.98% of current transactions remain unaffected
- Affected users can adapt by splitting large operations
- Minimal ecosystem disruption expected

### 2. Migration Path
- Clear error messages for rejected transactions
- Documentation for transaction splitting patterns
- Grace period for application updates

### 3. Monitoring Recommendations
- Track affected transaction patterns post-implementation
- Monitor address adaptation rates
- Measure actual vs. predicted impacts

## Conclusion

The empirical evidence strongly supports implementing EIP-7983's 16,777,216 gas cap. With only 0.02% of transactions affected and negligible economic impact, the proposal achieves its security and performance objectives while maintaining network usability. The benefits of enhanced DoS protection, improved zkVM compatibility, and better load balancing significantly outweigh the minimal costs.
